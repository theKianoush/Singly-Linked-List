# Singly-Linked-List

Program Description:
This program is an implementation of a singly linked list using strictly integer type, it has the following operations

1. insert a node - at the beginning, or a the end, or at a given position
2. delete a node - at the beginning, or at the end, or at a given position
3. Traversal - by going through and printing every element of the list - I recommend using this function regardless as it will tell you the status of the list and whats inside
4. Search - input an element(int number) and the function will return true or false if that element is in the list
5. Sort - sorts the list in acesnding order
6. Reverse - reverses the order of the list
